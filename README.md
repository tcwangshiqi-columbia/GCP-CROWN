# GCP-CROWN: General Cutting Planes for Bound-Propagation-Based Neural Network Verification

We generalize the bound propagation procedure (such as [CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.00866.pdf) and [β-CROWN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.06624.pdf)) to allow the addition of **arbitrary cutting plane constraints**, including those involving relaxed integer variables that do not appear in existing bound propagation formulations. Our generalized bound propagation method, **GCP-CROWN**, opens up the opportunity to apply general cutting plane methods for neural network verification while benefiting from the efficiency and GPU acceleration of bound propagation methods.

As a case study, we use cutting planes generated by a MIP solver, and find that it can generate high-quality cutting planes for strengthening bound-propagation-based verifiers using GCP-CROWN. Since the branching-focused bound propagation procedure and the cutting-plane-focused MIP solver can run in parallel utilizing both GPUs and CPUs, their combination can quickly explore a large number of branches with strong cutting planes, leading to strong verification performance. GCP-CROWN is the first verifier that can **completely solve the oval20 benchmark** and verify **twice as many** instances on the oval21 benchmark compared to the best tool in VNN-COMP 2021. GCP-CROWN is part of the [α,β-CROWN](http://abcrown.org), the VNN-COMP 2022 winner.

## Reproducing results

GCP-CROWN has been incorporated into our [α,β-CROWN](http://abcrown.org) verifier (alpha-beta-CROWN), which is the **winning tool of VNN-COMP 2022 and VNN-COMP 2021 with the highest total score**. To reproduce the results in the paper, please use the codebase in [α,β-CROWN repo](http://abcrown.org) following the detailed instructions below.

### Installation and setup

Our code is tested on Python 3.7+ and PyTorch 1.11. It can be installed
easily into a conda environment. If you don't have conda, you can install
[miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

```bash
# Clone the alpha-beta-CROWN verifier
git clone https://github.com/huanzhang12/alpha-beta-CROWN.git
cd alpha-beta-CROWN
# Remove the old environment, if necessary.
conda deactivate; conda env remove --name alpha-beta-crown
conda env create -f complete_verifier/environment.yml --name alpha-beta-crown  # install all dependents into the alpha-beta-crown environment
conda activate alpha-beta-crown  # activate the environment
```

We currently require the IBM CPLEX solver to find effective cuts for verification. It is free for students and
academics from
[here](https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/blogs/xavier-nodet1/2020/07/09/cplex-free-for-students).
Please run the following commands to install CPLEX solver and compile its C++ interfacing code:

```bash
# Install IBM CPLEX >= 22.1.0
# Download from https://community.ibm.com/community/user/datascience/blogs/xavier-nodet1/2020/07/09/cplex-free-for-students
chmod +x cplex_studio2210.linux_x86_64.bin  # Any version >= 22.1.0 should work. Change executable name here.
# You can directly run the installer: ./cplex_studio2210.linux_x86_64.bin; the response.txt created below is for non-interactive installation.
cat > response.txt <<EOF
INSTALLER_UI=silent
LICENSE_ACCEPTED=true
EOF
sudo ./cplex_studio2210.linux_x86_64.bin -f response.txt
# Build the C++ code for CPLEX interface. Assumming we are still inside the alpha-beta-CROWN folder.
sudo apt install build-essential  # A modern g++ (>=8.0) is required to compile the code.
# Change CPX_PATH in complete_verifier/CPLEX_cuts/Makefile if you installed CPlex to a non-default location, like inside your home folder.
make -C complete_verifier/CPLEX_cuts/
```
